# CLAUDE.md — sim-desktop (master)

> 🔴 **This file is an index.** It is auto-loaded into every session, so its length is a tax on
> every task. **Only rules that must never be missed stay inline** — everything else moved to
> [`sim-desktop.d/`](sim-desktop.d/). When you need to add depth, add it there, not here.
>
> The canonical copy is `~/ax-cluster/machines/sim-desktop.md`; `/home/sim/CLAUDE.md` is a
> **symlink** to it — never replace it with a regular file. Structure: [`README.md`](README.md).

## About this directory

`/home/sim` is the home directory on **sim-desktop**, a personal Linux home server — **not a
software repository.** There is no build, lint, or test tooling. **Don't assume a codebase exists.**

- Host `sim-desktop`, LAN **192.168.0.57** (plus Docker bridges 172.17–19.0.1)
- Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (jammy) · also reachable via xrdp (3389)
- Locale `ko_KR.UTF-8` — **the user communicates in Korean; reply in Korean.**
  (These guidance files are English on purpose: only Claude reads them, and Korean costs ~2.7×
  the tokens for the same content.)

## 🔴 Where the project stands — read this before planning

**Milestone 1 (infrastructure) is closed. Milestone 2 (digital twin restoration) is open.**

| | |
|---|---|
| Current milestone — **read only this one** | `~/ax-cluster/docs/milestones/2-twin-restoration.md` |
| Previous (kept, still valid) | `~/ax-cluster/docs/milestones/1-infrastructure.md` |

**Goals** (user, 2026-08-08): ① **author the ontology documents automatically** — context doc per
commit → relation graph → BM25 → then the ontology doc itself, which is **manual + conversational
with heuristics, not fully automatic** (auto-promotion was permanently disabled 2026-06-01)
② **feed the relevant slice of that twin to the code-writing agent.**

🔴 **The twin grows on changed files — 14 of 33 sub-tasks done.** Relation graphs (1,806 classes /
6,380 methods / 10,817 include edges) and context-MD synthesis are **wired into the indexer**.
Still missing: the ontology **LLM synthesis** (중 1.3 is 7/10 — everything deterministic is done)
and thesaurus alias data (0 registered). The 247 yaml
are **unindexed — 0 search hits**. So code the pipeline writes never enters the twin, and the RAG
drifts from reality silently. Breakdown 대 2 / 중 8 / 소 32; **main = 대 1 (making the data)**;
`/distribute`·`/review-work` stay 🕓 예정 (they *consume* the twin).

🔴 **Never size a task by line count** — `class_graph`'s 1,341 lines are *"delete the file → full
rescan on restart"*, while one 829-line file holds the domain index, norm search and the thesaurus
builder together.

🔴 **Say "done" only for a whole area**; otherwise give the denominator. And **don't pick the
next task yourself** — milestone 1 failed exactly that way.

## Role in the AX cluster — this box is the **master**

The project repo is cloned **here** at `~/ax-cluster` (`PLAN.md` is the index, content in `docs/`),
with copies on BC-250 #1 (`sim@192.168.0.43:~/ax-cluster`) and GitHub (`SimSeoWon/ax-cluster`,
**private — keep it that way**, it holds LAN addresses and firewall rules). Keep all three in sync.
The board has `main` checked out so pushing there is rejected — **`git pull` on that side instead.**
🔴 `~/AgentTest` is the predecessor clone — **reference only. Never modify or push to it.**

### `.33` — the main work PC has its own guide

SSH and Ollama came up 2026-08-08; **the account is `user`**. But 🔴 **it is not an inference
endpoint** — measured free VRAM **7651 MiB** is smaller than its own only model (8.95 GiB) and
than the coder model (9.0 GB), and opening UE5 takes more. Use it for **checks and remote
installs only** (`master/provision.py`, `resident=False`).

🔴 **This is the human's machine** — the master is a guest here: read-only by preference, dirty
check before anything that writes. Everything else — session-0 boundary, UE5 checkout path,
the Store-stub Python trap, local + commercial LLMs — lives in
**[`win-main-33.md`](win-main-33.md)**.

### `.2` — the Windows worker has its own guide

🔴 **The account is `janus`, not `sim`** — `ssh sim@192.168.0.2` fails with
`Permission denied (publickey,...)`. Everything else about that box — OS, session-0 boundary
(what the master can and cannot drive there), UE5 project path, local + commercial LLMs, the
SSH PATH trap — lives in **[`win-worker-2.md`](win-worker-2.md)**, which is also copied to
`C:\Users\janus\CLAUDE.md` so sessions on that machine load it.

✅ The master's services are reachable from `.2` — 8101, 8102, 8103 all verified (2026-08-08).

### Design rules (inherited from the AgentTest 2026-07-07 architecture)

- Inference nodes **never touch files** — only text (context / code fragments / diffs) crosses the
  wire. File I/O and builds happen on whichever machine owns the files.
- Master→node calls are **stateless** (Ollama `/api/generate`, with the `context` field
  deliberately not reused).
- **Deterministic gates (tests / type checkers / linters) outrank LLM judgment** for verification.
- 🔴 **Never shard a model across BC-250 boards** — each board is an independent endpoint and the
  master load-balances *requests*. The boards have 1GbE and no PCIe slots, so tensor/pipeline
  parallelism starves on bandwidth.

## 🔴 Work journal

Numbered work reports accumulate in `~/claude-workspace/reports/` (mirroring the BC-250's
`~/bc250-backup-staging/reports/` convention). Reports are written in Korean — the user reads them.

- **Read the reports in full at session start** — grep is not a substitute. There is an incident
  where near-miss wording was filtered out and already-recorded work got re-investigated.
- **For infra work that needs a reboot or risks losing access, write the intended commands to a
  report file *before* running them and update it *during* the work** — if the connection drops,
  the file is the only surviving record of what was attempted.
- Afterwards, also update the preceding report's "remaining" list with what got done.
